Available on Android (Play Store and F-Droid), iOS (App Store), as a web app and as a desktop app for Linux (Flathub, Snap Store). It even works on Linux phones by using the Arm64 version of the Flatpak/Snap. You can compile it for MacOS and Windows by yourself if you like, but that is not yet supported.",
        "how_do_i_create_an_account": "When you first launch the app, you'll be asked to create a new Matrix account. Select a server (e.g., matrix.org), enter your desired username, and a secure password. Optionally, you can add an email address (this is helpful for password recovery, but not required).",

        "i_forgot_my_password": "If you provided an email address when creating your account, you can reset your password via the server website (e.g., https://matrix.org). Unfortunately, recovery is not possible without an email address. In this case, you will need to create a new account.",

Enter your backup key or password when setting up FluffyChat on the new device. Only then can your messages be decrypted. If you haven't created a backup or have lost the key, your encrypted messages unfortunately cannot be restored.",
        "how_do_i_create_a_backup_key": "Open FluffyChat and go to the <b>settings</b> to the <b>Chat Backup</b>. There you can set up an <u>encrypted</u> chat backup. You will be asked to save a recovery key. Important: Make a note of this key or keep it safe. <b>Without it, you won't be able to restore your encrypted messages on a new device.</b>",
        "i_found_a_bug": "You can report bugs directly on Github. Alternatively, there's a public group chat on Messenger (#fluffy-space:matrix.org) where you can ask questions or send feedback.",
