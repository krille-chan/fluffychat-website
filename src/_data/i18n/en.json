Available on Android (Play Store and F-Droid), iOS (App Store), as a web app and as a desktop app for Linux (Flathub, Snap Store).

        "how_do_i_create_an_account": "When you first launch the app, you'll be asked to create a new Matrix account.

        "i_changed_my_device_encrypted_messages": "To read your encrypted messages on the new device, you need to restore the backup you created previously. Enter your backup key or password when setting up FluffyChat on the new device. Only then can your messages be decrypted. If you haven't created a backup or have lost the key, your encrypted messages unfortunately cannot be restored.",
        "how_do_i_create_a_backup_key": "Open FluffyChat and go to the <b>settings</b> to the <b>Chat Backup</b>. There you can set up an <u>encrypted</u> chat backup. You will be asked to save a recovery key. Important: Make a note of this key or keep it safe. <b>Without it, you won't be able to restore your encrypted messages on a new device.</b>",

        "how_to_use_end_to_end_encryption": "<p>FluffyChat supports end to end encryption. You can enable it per chat. Once enabled it cannot be disabled anymore for security reasons. You can not enable encryption for public rooms as this makes no sense when anyone can join and leave the room anyway. Once you have enabled encryption, the server is no longer able to read the content of your messages. It will encrypt all text messages and files.</p> <p>To be safe from man-in-the-middle attacks, you should take a look at the device list. You can do this in the encryption settings of a chat. Is there a suspicious device which you or your chat partner don&#39;t know? Then you can block it by moving the toggle to the left.</p> <p>The color of the toggle shows you the security state. Orange means, that this device is not verified. Grey means that it is blocked and won&#39;t receive the encryption keys. This means that this device won&#39;t be able to read your messages anymore! Green means that this device is verified.</p> <p>To verify the devices of another user, start the verification in a direct chat. For this you have a &quot;Start verification&quot; button in the encryption settings of a direct chat. Be sure that you are standing next to this person or you are connected via phone or any other secure channel. When you have started the verification, you will both see a set of emojis on your device. Compare them and tap on &quot;They match&quot;. Wait a little bit and then you should see that all devices become green.</p>",

You can&#39;t be awake 24 hours a day so you must decide how you protect your users by chosing one of the following methods:</p> <ol> <li>Make your fork as minimal as possible and enable repository mirroring.
